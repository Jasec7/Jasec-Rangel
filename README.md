## Skills
_ _After graduating from highschool I decided to pursuit a culinary carreer where it took me two years until I got my bachelord's degree as a professional cook. Then i started working as a cook, gathering experience and inbetween I also did a bartending course having on that way knowledge both food and beverages. However on my third year in the career I had the oportunity to travel abroad and learn english changing the course of my life because I was lucky to stay in E.E.U.U and live there. In my time here I switched my cooking career to bartending and I've had the oportunity to improve my customer service skills plus knowledge about food and beverage besides learning  100% the language._ _
